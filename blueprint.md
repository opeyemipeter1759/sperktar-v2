# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A modern, scalable, and data-driven Next.js application. This project is built with a focus on best practices, including a modular architecture, reusable components, and a data-driven approach to content management.

## Style and Design

The application features a modern and visually appealing design with a consistent theme. Key design elements include:

*   **Glassmorphism:** Used to create a sense of depth and transparency.
*   **Modern Components:** Sleek, reusable components for a consistent user experience.
*   **Visually Balanced Layout:** Clean spacing and a well-organized structure.
*   **Polished Styles:** Easy-to-understand styles that enhance readability.

## Features

*   **Homepage:** A welcoming page with a brief introduction and a showcase of recent work.
*   **Services Page:** A detailed overview of the services offered, including a bento grid, a "Why Choose Us" section, and a step-by-step breakdown of the build process.
*   **Recent Work Section:** A grid of projects with images, titles, descriptions, and links to case studies.
*   **Work Page:** A dedicated page to showcase all of the projects.
*   **Contact Page:** A page with a contact form that includes backend validation.
*   **Data-Driven Content:** All content is managed in separate data files, making it easy to update and maintain.
*   **Reusable Components:** The application is built with a library of reusable components, ensuring a consistent design and a more efficient development process.

## Current Plan

**Implement a contact form with backend validation.**

*   **Install `zod`** for validation.
*   **Create a Server Action** to handle the form submission.
*   **Create a `ContactForm` component** as a Client Component.
*   **Create a `contact` page** to display the form.
